# Pyautogui basics
This is my mini_project to create a user defined automation without coding required.
Just need python and requirements.txt installed and you can create your own tasks.
## Supports: Single Left Click and Enter. Adding more functionality.
## Using PyAutoGui, WebBrowser, Pickle and Pynput
There are two folders:
1. Open google meet ( can join most recent meet with audio muted and video turned off which is scheduled in calendar.)
2. Create Your own Task ( Run the program and all the clicks will be recorded. Precise instructions in the program itself)
